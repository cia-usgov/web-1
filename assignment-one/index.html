       <p> <strong>Hey! My name is Ben, </strong>and this is my first website. Here is a bit about me, I am 25 years old and currently enrolled at <em>NSCC</em> for <em>Graphic Design.</em> I love music and visual art, in my free time I play in a band and do freelance screen printing. I am excited to learn more about coding and making websites, I think it'll prove to be extremnely useful in my future endeavors.</p>
